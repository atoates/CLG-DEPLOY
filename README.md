# Crypto Lifeguard — In-Browser Demo

A zero-dependency web prototype you can open in any modern browser. It lets users:

- Search and **select tokens** to watch
- See **dummy alerts** with severity icons (🚨 / ⚠️ / 🛟) and **live countdowns**
- Read a **mock AI weekly summary** tailored to selected tokens

## How to run

1. Download the three files in this folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `app.js`
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click it). No build or server needed.

## Notes

- This is a front-end only demo. All data is hardcoded and stored in memory (with localStorage for selected tokens).
- Colours follow the brand palette (Ocean Blue, Lifeguard Yellow, Coral Red, Sandy Beige).
- You can type any token symbol (e.g., `BTC`, `ETH`, `MATIC`). Unknown symbols that look valid (A–Z/0–9) are allowed for demo.
- The weekly summary is mocked; in a full app this would be generated by an LLM from real data.

### Auth (optional)
- Set environment variables to enable Google SSO (demo implementation):
   - `BASE_URL` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for local)
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Visit `/signup` to start; `/profile` shows current user and prefs.
