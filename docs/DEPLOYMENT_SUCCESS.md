## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Find Your Admin Panel URL
Go to Railway dashboard and copy your CLG-ADMIN public URL.

### 2. Test the Deployment

#### Basic Health Check
```bash
# Replace with your actual Railway URL
curl https://your-clg-admin-url.railway.app
```

Should return the HTML of your admin panel.

#### Login Test
1. Visit your admin panel URL in browser
2. Should see login page
3. Enter admin credentials
4. Should redirect to dashboard

#### News Management Test
1. Click "News Feed" in sidebar
2. Check if it loads (may be empty if no news cached)
3. Click "Refresh Cache" button
4. Should fetch articles from CoinDesk RSS
5. Try editing an article
6. Try deleting an article
7. Test search and filters

### 3. Verify Backend Connection

Check browser console (F12) for:
- ✅ No CORS errors
- ✅ API calls to https://app.crypto-lifeguard.com succeed
- ✅ 200 OK responses

If you see errors:
- 401 Unauthorized → Check admin token
- CORS errors → Check ADMIN_DASHBOARD_URL in backend

### 4. Monitor Logs

In Railway dashboard:
```bash
# Watch real-time logs
railway logs -f
```

Or in Railway web UI:
- Go to Deployments tab
- Click latest deployment
- View logs

### 5. Performance Check

Expected metrics:
- **Page Load**: < 2 seconds
- **API Response**: < 500ms
- **Login**: < 1 second

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't access admin panel URL
**Check:**
1. Railway service is running (green status)
2. Domain is configured in Railway settings
3. No deployment errors in Railway logs

**Fix:**
- Redeploy if needed: `railway up`
- Check Railway dashboard for deployment status

### Issue: Login fails
**Check:**
1. Admin token matches backend ADMIN_TOKEN
2. Backend is running (check CLG-DEPLOY logs)
3. CORS allows your admin panel URL

**Fix:**
```bash
# In CLG-DEPLOY backend
ADMIN_DASHBOARD_URL=https://your-clg-admin-url.railway.app
```

### Issue: News Feed shows "Unauthorized"
**Check:**
1. Admin token in localStorage
2. Backend /admin/news/* endpoints exist
3. Bearer token sent in Authorization header

**Debug in browser console:**
```javascript
// Check token
localStorage.getItem('admin_token')

// Test API directly
fetch('https://app.crypto-lifeguard.com/admin/news/stats', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('admin_token')}` }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

### Issue: News Feed empty
**This is normal!** If no news cached yet:
1. Click "Refresh Cache" button
2. Wait 2-3 seconds
3. Articles should appear

### Issue: CORS errors
**Backend needs to whitelist your admin panel URL:**

In CLG-DEPLOY `.env`:
```bash
ADMIN_DASHBOARD_URL=https://your-actual-clg-admin-url.railway.app
```

Then restart CLG-DEPLOY service.

- ✅ Admin panel loads in browser
